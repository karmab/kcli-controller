# DEMO

## who am i ?

- karim boumedhel 
- member of the application integration engineering team (tommy hugues team lead)

## what will we see?

- custom controller written with the client-python kubernetes library
- use of custom resource definitions (crd), the tpr successor
- a (kind of) fancy UI interacting with the controller (only dealing with crd actually)

## motivation

- ease the path for python folks to write code in kubernetes word
- replicate common pattern recently seen upstream with controllers and crd ( for instance fission and istio )
- note this demo doesnt use the python openshift api ( although work has also been done in this sprint regarding this,( PR included),  toward creating an istio-openshift-initializer )

##  demo time

```
bash demo.sh

## interested in the demo tooling ?

- me sending a mail

##  questions?
